# Po Aquifer System Flow Simulation

## Overview

This repository contains code and input files for simulating the Po aquifer system flow. The simulation model is designed to help understand and optimize the behavior of the aquifer under various conditions. The provided code allows you to run individual simulations and perform optimizations to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the model.

## Repository Structure

- code/ogs6hetPermAquiferLim13-19/`: Contains all the necessary input files required to run the simulations.
- `results/`: Directory for storing simulation outputs and results for sensitivity analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Python 3.8+

- The optimization code can run in parrallel in a linux server.


### Running a Simulation

To run a single forward simulation, use the `DeOGS6_2016hetPerm`. This script reads input files executes the model.


## Input Files

The `code/ogs6hetPermAquiferLim13-19/` directory contains all necessary files to run the simulations. Make sure these files are correctly formatted and contain the required data before running any simulations.
